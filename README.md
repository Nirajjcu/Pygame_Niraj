# Pygame_Niraj
I am adding my builtup games in python in this repo.
You guys are free to leave ideas
Get back to me in nirajcit@gmail.com. Tick-Tac-Toe is now completed. "Ticklast2.py" is the final version of it with Artificial Intelligence implemented with it which means that computer will intelligently move its step to win or to not give chance to player to win. However it may result in error in user input wrong data, which will be fixed soon. 
Thank you
